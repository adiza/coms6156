# **Final Project  - COMS 6156** 

## Presenter: Adiza Awwal
## _Topics in Software Engineering_ - **Professor. Gail Kaiser**
## **video justification:** I do not have Xcode installed on my machine.
##  **vocabulary:** A low-code development platform (LCDP) is software that provides an environment programmers use to create application software through graphical user interfaces and configuration instead of traditional computer programming.

### **Midterm Research Project:** The impact on software system maintainability using low-code

#### Findings:
1. Overall, low-code showed that it increases developers
perceived productivity or remains on par with traditional programming. 
2. Additionally,
low-code product quality remains comparable to traditional programming. 

3. Lastly,low-code perceives to be less maintainable or equally as maintainable to traditional
programming.

## **Final Project Research Intention**:
### I would like to investigate application development process for traditional programming in comparison to low-code development. 

## **Development Platforms:**
* Microsoft PowerApps 
* React Native with Expo

## Contextual Considerations:

* Low Code development is often targeted towards non-technical industry professionals, "citizen developers" (e.g. corporate IT professionals) and non-technical facing people in general

* My applications are business oriented and should be viewed as internal applications within a corporate setting.
